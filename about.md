Mod that adds access to rewards in the pause menu.

You can change which side buttons are on in the mod settings.

## Texture Pack

Alternatively, you can get this as a texture pack if you have the Happy Textures mod, although positions are not changable.

Find it in [latest releases](https://github.com/Kingminer7/quests-in-pause/releases/latest) or possibly in Texture Workshop.
